      Options explained:
      
      travel_axis="x": his means that the movement was design with an
      object traveling left or right in mind.

      Type "xyz_difference" defaults:
      
      Should be inherently be repeatable, though that can be
      overridden.
      
      repeatable="true"
      
      Step distance defaults to "average".
      
      step_speed="average"
      
      If step_speed times the number of steps does not reach 100%
      then and the movement by is repeatable the default is to
      loop/repeat the movement.
      
      To the contrary, if the step_speed exceeds 100% then some
      steps may never be reached.
      
      If the movement somehow results in the object not arriving at
      its intended destination then a correction is automatically made
      in the code that uses the movement to ensure the object
      arrives. In the case of an xyz_difference that means that a
      final step is added where x, y and z are all 0.0.
      
      With xyz_difference, when step_speed is a percentage, if a
      particular step is a large change is distance the object on
      screen will move very quickly to cover that ground. The inverse
      is also true for a short distance, an object will move slowly if
      the distance to cover is small for that step.
      
      To the contrary if step_speed is set to "constant" then the
      object will maintain a constant speed throughout the entire
      movement. If the object does not reach its intended destination
      an adjustment will automatically be made at the end of the
      movement.
