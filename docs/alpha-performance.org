An SDL Per-Surface Alpha Performance Test:

* TODO compare SDL_SetColorKey, SDL_SetAlpha, SDL_SetAlphaChannel

* Objective
 - Show performance of using a per-surface alpha value
 - Show performance of SDL_RLEACCEL
 - Show performance of alpha channel vs full image opacity
 - Show performance of image conversion using SDL_DisplayFormat and
   SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha
 - Show performance differences between different alpha values (for
   example an alpha value of 128 is supposed to be optimized).
* Conditions
Hardware:
 - MSI A6400 Laptop
 - 4GB RAM, DDR III 2GB * 2
 - LCD Screen, 15.6" HD 1366x768
 - Intel Core i5-2410M CPU @ 2.30GHz Ã— 4
 - Intel HD Graphics 3000
Software:
 - Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 LTS
 - SDL 1.2, sdlgfx 1.2, SDL_Image 1.2
 - Video Mode 800x600@32bpp windowed. SDL Double Buffering. No OpenGL.
 - Images were loaded using IMG_Load from the SDL_image library.
 - Images were drawn directly on top of each other at (0,0) and
   directly onto a topmost "display" surface.
 - Framerate set to 200 and managed by sdlgfx's SDL_framerate.h.

* Disclaimer
 - Alpha effects surface blitting in many ways. This test by no means
   comes remotely close to testing all the different scenarios.
 - For more info: http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdlsetalpha.html

* Column descriptions:

Type:
 - Full: No alpha channel. Full image opacity adjustment.
   - (1) SDL_SetAlpha (2) SDL_DisplayFormat.
 - Channel: Self-explanatory.
   - (1) SDL_SetColorKey (2) SDL_SetAlpha (3) SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha
 - None: No alpha.
   - (1) SDL_DisplayFormat
   - Event though no alpha value is used, this is helpful because it
     shows the performance hit if converting each time vs caching.

SDL_RLEACCEL:
   - An acceleration feature
   - Indicates if SDL_RLEACCEL was passed to SDL_SetAlpha.
   - Note that another flag, "SDL_SRCALPHA", was always included in
     SDL_SetAlpha calls.

FPS *:
 - Frames Per Second
 - Jumpy framerates are roughly averaged out using a quick
   guesstimate.
 - FPS Conv:
   - Images are converted each time.
 - FPS Cache:
   - Images are converted once and cached.
   BG Conv:
   - The framerate when the aforementioned blue-green 800x600 BMP
     image was used as the background.

Alpha:
 - Alpha value
   -   0, fully transparent
   - 255, fully opaque

* Observations
 - 255 (fully opaque) or 0 (full transparent) have the best
   performance characteristics, with 128 coming in a distant 3rd
   place. 128 is optimized,
   http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdlsetalpha.html
 - In 'Test set #2' having a background may improve performance when
   alpha is 0, alpha channel is used and SDL_RLEACCEL is used. Other
   scenarios show no improvement. I don't understand why this is.
 - 255 (fully opaque) with full image alpha or alpha channel and
   SDL_RLEACCEL seem to be as performant as when no alpha is used at
   all. Therefore, defaulting application settings to enable alpha
   seems reasonable. The benefit of such a default is that the user
   would likely expect alpha features to work without having to
   specifically be enabled on a per image basis, and so long as the
   alpha value is 255 (fully opaque) there is no performance hit.
