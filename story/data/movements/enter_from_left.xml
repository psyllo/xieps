  <!--
      A movement of type "path" should contain a list of xyz points
      with at least two points defining the start and finish.

      Type "path" defaults:
      
      repeatable="false"
      
      Should probably only be repeatable if the path is a loop.
      
      step_speed="constant"
      
      A constant speed seems to fit most "path" type scenarios.
